## **Note Creation Process**

* **Important:** When using the Ctrl+Alt+A command, a new note is automatically added to the inbox folder with the title entered in the text box that appears after executing the command.
* The note title and the file name are the same and must be unique; if they are not, a consecutive number is automatically added at the end of the name.
* The creation and modification dates are autogenerated during creation. The modification date allows personal tracking of when the note is changed, but from its creation onward, its maintenance is manual.
* The note will follow the format indicated below in the example.
* Once the note is completed, it is simply dragged to the appropriate folder (you may create subfolders within these parent folders if it helps with your organization).
* Each folder has a note (without content) created as an example of the type of content and categorization that can be used as a reference for your notes.
  Consistency with tags and topics is recommended for better content exploration later on.
