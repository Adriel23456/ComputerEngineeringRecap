## 📚 Idea/Concept

When a metal touches a semiconductor, the system reaches equilibrium by aligning Fermi levels. That causes charge transfer and band bending near the interface.

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- After contact: a single common E_F across both materials.
- Depending on φ_M vs φ_S, the contact can be:
  - rectifying (Schottky-like)
  - ohmic-like (low resistance)
