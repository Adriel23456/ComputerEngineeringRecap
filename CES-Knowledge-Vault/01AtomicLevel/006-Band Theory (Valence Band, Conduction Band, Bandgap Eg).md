## 📚 Idea/Concept

In solids, electron energies form bands:
- Valence Band (VB): mostly filled bonding states
- Conduction Band (CB): states where electrons move freely
- Bandgap Eg: forbidden energy region between VB and CB

Eg = E_C - E_V

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Metals: no gap / overlapping bands -> easy conduction.
- Insulators: huge Eg -> almost no carriers.
- Semiconductors (Si): moderate Eg -> controllable conduction.
