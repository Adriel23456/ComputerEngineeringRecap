## 📚 Idea/Concept

Crystalline silicon forms a tetrahedral network of four covalent bonds per atom (often described as sp³ hybridization). The periodic lattice creates a periodic potential -> which leads to energy bands.

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- At low temperature, most electrons are locked in bonds (low conduction).
- Thermal energy breaks some bonds, creating:
  - free electrons (conduction)
  - holes (missing bonding electron -> effective positive carrier)

## 🔗 Connections
- [[006-Band Theory (Valence Band, Conduction Band, Bandgap Eg)]]
- [[010-Charge Carriers & Transport (Drift, Diffusion, Current Density)]]
- [[007-Fermi Level (Intrinsic vs Doped)]]

## 💡 Personal Insight (Optional)
- Holes are a clean abstraction: “missing electron” behaving like a real carrier.
