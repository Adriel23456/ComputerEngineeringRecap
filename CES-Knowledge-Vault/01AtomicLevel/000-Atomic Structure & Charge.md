## 📚 Idea/Concept

Matter is built from atoms: a **nucleus** (protons + neutrons) surrounded by **electrons**. The key for engineering is that **electric charge** and **electron behavior** explain materials, fields, and current.

- Proton charge: +e  
- Electron charge: -e  
- Elementary charge: e = 1.602×10^-19 C

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Atomic number Z = number of protons (defines the element).
- Neutral atom: electrons = protons.
- Electrons dominate bonding and conduction.

- [[010-Charge Carriers & Transport (Drift, Diffusion, Current Density)]]

## 💡 Personal Insight (Optional)
- In CSE, “charge” becomes signals, bits, and energy cost—this is the physical root.

## 🧾 Resources (Optional)
- Intro Modern Physics notes
