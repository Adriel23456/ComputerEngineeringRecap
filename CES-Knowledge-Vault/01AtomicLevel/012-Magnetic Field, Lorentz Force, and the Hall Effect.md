## 📚 Idea/Concept

Moving charges in fields experience the Lorentz force:
F = q(E + v × B)

This explains magnetic deflection of carriers and supports the Hall effect (used to identify carrier type and density in semiconductors).

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Hall effect can distinguish n-type vs p-type materials.
- Used in sensors and semiconductor characterization.
