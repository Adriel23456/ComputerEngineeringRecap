## 📚 Idea/Concept

Electrons occupy **quantum states** described by orbitals (probability distributions), not classical circular paths.

Four quantum numbers define an electron state:

- Principal n = 1,2,3,...
- Azimuthal l = 0 ... n-1  (shape: s,p,d,f)
- Magnetic m_l = -l ... +l (orientation)
- Spin m_s = ±1/2

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Orbital types:
  - l=0 -> s
  - l=1 -> p
  - l=2 -> d
  - l=3 -> f
- Each orbital holds 2 electrons (Pauli exclusion principle).

- [[003-Energy Quantization & the Electron-Volt (eV)]]
- [[004-Valence Electrons & Chemical Bonding (focus on Si)]]

## 💡 Personal Insight (Optional)
- Orbitals are “state spaces” with constraints—very similar to CS thinking.
