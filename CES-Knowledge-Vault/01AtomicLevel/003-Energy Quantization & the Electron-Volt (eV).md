## 📚 Idea/Concept

Atomic systems have **quantized energy levels**. A key unit in atomic/solid-state physics is the electron-volt:

1 eV = 1.602×10^-19 J

Hydrogen-like model (conceptual baseline):
E_n = -13.6 / n^2  eV
As n -> infinity, E -> 0 eV (unbound electron).

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- “More negative” energy = more strongly bound.
- Allowed vs forbidden energies in atoms becomes bands in solids.
