## 📚 Idea/Concept

Current comes from charge carriers moving:
- electrons
- holes (in semiconductors)

Transport mechanisms:
- Drift: motion due to electric field E
- Diffusion: motion due to concentration gradients

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Metals: many free electrons -> high conductivity.
- Semiconductors: carriers depend on temperature/doping -> controllable conductivity.
