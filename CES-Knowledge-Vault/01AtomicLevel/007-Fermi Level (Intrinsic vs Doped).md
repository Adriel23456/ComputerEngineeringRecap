## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Fermi level E_F is the equilibrium energy reference that controls occupation of electron states.

- Intrinsic silicon: E_F is ~near midgap.
- Doping shifts E_F:
  - n-type (donors) -> E_F closer to E_C
  - p-type (acceptors) -> E_F closer to E_V

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- E_F strongly influences carrier concentration.
- Doping is how silicon becomes “engineerable”.
