## 📚 Idea/Concept

Valence electrons drive bonding and decide if a material behaves like a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator.

Bond types:
- Covalent: electron sharing (dominant in Si)
- Ionic: electron transfer (large electronegativity difference)
- Metallic: delocalized electrons (“electron sea”)

Rule-of-thumb for ionic character:
Δχ ≳ 1.6  -> mostly ionic

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Silicon has 4 valence electrons -> tends to form 4 covalent bonds.
- This bonding is the physical reason silicon is an ideal semiconductor base.
