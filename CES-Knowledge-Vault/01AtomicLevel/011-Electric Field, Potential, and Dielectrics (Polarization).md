## 📚 Idea/Concept

An electric field exerts force on charge:
F = qE

A dielectric polarizes in an external field, creating bound charges that reduce the internal effective field (core physics behind capacitors and insulation).

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Dielectrics reduce the net field inside the material.
- Polarization explains “charge induced” diagrams and capacitor behavior.
