## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. They are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team's overall efficiency and effectiveness. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

### Development Team Characteristics

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               DEVELOPMENT TEAM CHARACTERISTICS                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SELF-ORGANIZING                                                │
│  • Chooses how to accomplish work                               │
│  • No one tells them how to turn backlog into Increments        │
│  • Collectively owns the Sprint Backlog                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CROSS-FUNCTIONAL                                               │
│  • Has all skills needed to create Increment                    │
│  • No sub-teams or hierarchies                                  │
│  • Shared responsibility regardless of individual skills        │

│  • No individual titles                                         │
│  • Success and failure belong to the team                       │

### Optimal Team Size

```
Recommended: 3-9 members

Too Small (<3):
- Limited skill coverage
- Single point of failure
- Reduced interaction benefits

Too Large (>9):
- Coordination overhead
- Communication complexity
- Sub-groups tend to form

Formula: 
Communication channels = n(n-1)/2
  5 people = 10 channels
  7 people = 21 channels
  9 people = 36 channels
```

### Team Composition Considerations

Skills Needed:
- Analysis and design
- Development/coding
- Testing/QA
- Documentation
- DevOps/deployment

T-Shaped Professionals:

### Self-Organization Levels

| Level | Description | Team Behavior |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Told | Follows instructions |
| 2 | Consulted | Provides input on decisions |
| 3 | Agreeing | Joint decision making |
| 4 | Advising | Team decides, manager advises |
| 5 | Self-Organized | Team fully autonomous |

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- The team, not the Scrum Master, owns the Sprint Backlog
- Cross-functionality doesn't mean everyone does everything
- Self-organization requires trust and psychological safety
- High-performing teams develop over time through stages (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing)
