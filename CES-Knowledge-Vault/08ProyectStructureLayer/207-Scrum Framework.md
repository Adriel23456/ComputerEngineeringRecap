## 📚 Idea/Concept

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and maintaining complex products. It defines a set of roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment) that work together in iterative cycles called Sprints. Scrum is based on empiricism and lean thinking, emphasizing transparency, inspection, and adaptation to manage complexity and uncertainty in product development.

### Three Pillars of Empiricism

Transparency:
- Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
- Common language and shared understanding
- Definition of Done understood by all

Inspection:
- Scrum users must frequently inspect artifacts and progress
- Detect undesirable variances
- Not so frequent that inspection gets in the way of work

Adaptation:
- Adjust process or materials when deviations are detected
- Minimize further deviation
- Four formal events for inspection and adaptation

### Five Scrum Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Commitment | Team commits to achieving goals |
| Courage | Team has courage to do the right thing |
| Focus | Everyone focuses on Sprint work and team goals |
| Openness | Team and stakeholders are open about work and challenges |
| Respect | Team members respect each other's capabilities |

### Sprint Cycle

```
Product       Sprint        Sprint        Daily         Sprint      Retrospective
Backlog   →   Planning  →   Backlog   →   Scrum    →   Review   →  
    ↑                                                      │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        (Increment)
```

### Time-boxes

- Sprint: 1-4 weeks (typically 2 weeks)
- Sprint Planning: Max 8 hours for 4-week Sprint
- Daily Scrum: 15 minutes
- Sprint Review: Max 4 hours for 4-week Sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: Max 3 hours for 4-week Sprint

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Scrum is simple to understand but difficult to master
- Its power lies in understanding the "why" behind each element
- Scrum exposes organizational problems quickly, which can be uncomfortable but essential for improvement
