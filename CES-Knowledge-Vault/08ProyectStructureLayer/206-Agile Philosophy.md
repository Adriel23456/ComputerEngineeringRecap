## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Agile Philosophy is a set of values, principles, and practices for software development that prioritizes continuous value delivery, collaboration, adaptability to change, and customer satisfaction. It emerged in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, establishing 4 fundamental values and 12 principles that revolutionized software development. Agile is not a specific methodology, but a mindset that emphasizes short iterations, constant feedback, self-organized teams, and continuous improvement.

### The 4 Values of the Agile Manifesto

| We Value More | Over |
|---------------|------|
| Individuals and interactions | Processes and tools |
| Working software | Comprehensive documentation |
| Customer collaboration | Contract negotiation |
| Responding to change | Following a plan |

### The 12 Agile Principles

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient method of communication
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—maximizing work not done
11. Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs
12. Regular reflection and adjustment of team behavior

### Core Agile Characteristics

Iterative and Incremental Development:
- Work in short cycles with functional deliverables
- Each iteration produces potentially shippable product
- Continuous refinement based on feedback

Self-Organized Teams:
- Shared autonomy and responsibility
- Teams decide how to accomplish work
- Cross-functional capabilities

Continuous Improvement:
- Regular retrospectives
- Constant adaptation of processes
- Learning from each iteration

Time-boxed Work:
- Fixed periods for maintaining focus
- Predictable delivery rhythm
- Sustainable pace

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- Agile is a culture more than a set of practices
- The true agility comes from understanding that change is inevitable
- Not about going fast, but about delivering value constantly and learning in each iteration
