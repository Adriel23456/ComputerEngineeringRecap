## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They help everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. The Scrum Master serves the Development Team, Product Owner, and Organization by facilitating Scrum events, removing impediments, coaching team members, and helping the organization adopt Scrum practices effectively.
