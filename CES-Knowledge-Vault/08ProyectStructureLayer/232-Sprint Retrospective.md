## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is a 3-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints (proportionally less for shorter Sprints). The Sprint Retrospective is the primary mechanism for continuous improvement in Scrum.

### Sprint Retrospective Structure

### Retrospective Techniques

| Technique | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Start-Stop-Continue | Three columns of actions | Simple, regular use |
| 4 L's | Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For | Balanced reflection |
| Mad-Sad-Glad | Emotional check-in | Team feelings |
| Sailboat | Wind (helps), Anchors (slows), Rocks (risks) | Visual teams |
| Dot Voting | Prioritize items | Decision making |
| 5 Whys | Root cause analysis | Deep problems |
| Timeline | Events on Sprint timeline | Complex Sprints |

### Creating Psychological Safety

```
GROUND RULES FOR SAFE RETROSPECTIVES:

• What's said here stays here
• Assume positive intent
• Focus on process, not people
• Everyone's opinion matters
• No blame, only learning
• It's okay to disagree respectfully
• All feedback is valid
```

### Action Items

Characteristics of Good Actions:
- Specific and measurable
- Has an owner
- Time-bound
- Achievable within one Sprint
- Added to next Sprint Backlog

Example:
```
❌ "Improve code quality"
✓ "Add linting to CI pipeline by Tuesday (Owner: Alex)"

❌ "Communicate better"
✓ "Start using Slack thread for technical discussions (Owner: Team)"
```

### Tracking Improvements

```
Improvement Tracking Board:

│ Identified │ In Progress │ Implemented │ Validated │
├────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼───────────┤
│ Action 5   │ Action 3    │ Action 2    │ Action 1  │
│ Action 6   │ Action 4    │             │           │
```

### Common Anti-patterns

- Same issues every Sprint (not addressing root causes)
- Too many action items (pick 1-3 max)
- No follow-through (actions forgotten)
- Blame game (not safe environment)
- Skipping the retro (continuous improvement stops)

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- The Retrospective is the engine of continuous improvement
- Without psychological safety, honest feedback won't emerge
- Follow through on actions, or the team loses faith
- Vary the format to keep it fresh and engaging

- Whiteboard with Start-Stop-Continue columns and sticky notes
