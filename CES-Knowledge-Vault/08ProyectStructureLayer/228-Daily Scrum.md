## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. It is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. The Daily Scrum optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. It is not a status meeting for managers but a planning meeting for the Development Team.

### Daily Scrum Format

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        DAILY SCRUM                              │
│                      (15 minutes max)                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TIME:  Same time every day                                     │
│  PLACE: Same location (or virtual room)                         │
│  WHO:   Development Team (others may observe)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TRADITIONAL THREE QUESTIONS:                                   │
│                                                                 │
│  1. What did I do yesterday that helped the team                │
│     meet the Sprint Goal?                                       │
│                                                                 │
│  2. What will I do today to help the team                       │
│     meet the Sprint Goal?                                       │
│                                                                 │
│  3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or                 │
│     the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MODERN FOCUS: Walk the Board                                   │
│                                                                 │
│  • Focus on work items, not people                              │
│  • What's blocked?                                              │
│  • What needs attention today?                                  │
│  • Are we on track for Sprint Goal?                             │

### Purpose and Benefits

Synchronization:
- Everyone knows what others are working on
- Identifies collaboration opportunities
- Reveals impediments early

Planning:
- Creates daily work plan
- Adjusts based on new information
- Maintains Sprint momentum

Transparency:
- Progress visible to all
- Problems surface quickly
- No surprises at Sprint end

### Best Practices

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Stand up | Keeps meeting short |
| Face the board | Focus on work, not people |
| Same time/place | Builds routine |
| 15 min max | Respects time |
| Team-run | Builds ownership |
| Parking lot | Defer detailed discussions |

### Common Anti-patterns

```
❌ Status Report         → Focus on collaboration, not reporting
❌ Problem-solving       → Take offline, use "parking lot"
❌ Always 15 minutes     → End when done, don't fill time
❌ Scrum Master runs it  → Team should self-facilitate
❌ Late arrivals         → Respect others' time
❌ Not standing          → Encourages long discussions
❌ Skipping days         → Breaks rhythm and transparency
```

### Walk the Board Approach

```
Board Flow:  Done ← Testing ← In Progress ← To Do

Walk right to left:
1. What's close to Done? Any blockers?
2. What's in Testing? Need reviews?
3. What's In Progress? Any help needed?
4. What should we start today?
```

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- The Daily Scrum is FOR the team, BY the team
- Scrum Master removes impediments identified here
- Detailed discussions happen after the meeting
- It's about the Sprint Goal, not individual status
