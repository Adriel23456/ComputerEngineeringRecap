## 📚 Idea/Concept

The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

### Key Principles

Inspect & Adapt:
- Review actual working software
- Get real stakeholder feedback
- Adapt plans based on learning

Collaboration, Not Presentation:
- Two-way dialogue
- Stakeholders actively participate
- Everyone can ask questions

Demo "Done" Work Only:
- Only items meeting DoD
- Working software, not slideshows
- Real environment when possible

### What to Demonstrate

```
✓ Completed User Stories
✓ Working features in production-like environment
✓ User-facing functionality
✓ Technical improvements (if visible impact)

✗ Incomplete work
✗ PowerPoint presentations
✗ Mockups or wireframes
✗ Work that doesn't meet DoD
```

### Feedback Collection

Types of Feedback:
- Validation: "This is exactly what we needed"
- Clarification: "Can you explain how X works?"
- Suggestion: "Could we also add Y?"
- Change request: "Actually, we need Z instead"

Documentation:
- Capture feedback immediately
- Create backlog items as needed
- Note priority changes
- Record decisions made

### Sprint Review vs Sprint Demo

| Aspect | Demo (Anti-pattern) | Review (Correct) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Focus | Showing work | Getting feedback |
| Tone | Presentation | Conversation |
| Attendees | Passive audience | Active participants |
| Outcome | Applause | Backlog updates |
| Questions | After demo | Throughout |

## 📌 Key Points (Optional)
- The Sprint Review is not a "demo" - it's a working session
- Stakeholder feedback is essential for product success
- The Product Backlog should be updated based on what's learned
- It's about inspecting the Increment and adapting the plan
